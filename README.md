## GE Appliances Reverse Engineering

This repository contains notes, scripts, and libraries I have created and/or used to reverse engineer parts from newer GE appliances.
Most notably, I've written lots of documentation that explains how GE's serial communication bus works with various parts, such as
induction generator boards and inverters.
Hopefully, this repository comes in handy for anyone interested in hacking smart connected appliances to re-use parts or add features.
